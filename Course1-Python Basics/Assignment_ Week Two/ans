Write one for loop to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.
my_str = "MICHIGAN"
for i in range(len(my_str)):
    print(my_str[i])

2.Write one for loop to print out each element of the list several_things. Then, write another for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the list several_things. To complete this problem you should have written two different for loops, each of which iterates over the list several_things, but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.
Ans:
several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]
for i in range(len(several_things)):
    print(several_things[i])
    
for j in range(len(several_things)):
    print(type(several_things[j]))
    
Write code that uses iteration to print out the length of each element of the list stored in str_list.
str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]

# Write your code here.
for i in range(len(str_list)):
    print(len(str_list[i]))

original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."
num_chars = 0

4. Write code to count the number of characters in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_chars. Do NOT use the len function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)
for i in original_str:
    num_chars = num_chars + 1
    print(num_chars)
    
 5.# addition_str is a string with a list of numbers separated by the + sign.
# Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to sum_val (an integer).
# (You should use the .split("+") function to split by "+" and int() to cast to an integer).

addition_str = "2+5+10+20"
sum_val = 0

for i in addition_str:
    sum_val = sum(map(int,addition_str.split("+")))
    print(sum_val)
    
 6.
# week_temps_f is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the , sign.
# Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to avg_temp.
# Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in week_temps_f)
# (You should use the .split(",") function to split by "," and float() to cast to a float).

week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"

avg_temp = 0.0

for i in week_temps_f:
    avg_temp = sum(map(float,week_temps_f.split(","))) / 7
    print(avg_temp)
    
 7.# Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable nums. Do not hard code the list.

nums = list(range(0, 68))
print(nums)

8.# Write code to create a list of word lengths for the words in original_str,
# using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_words_list.
# (You should use the len function).

original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox"

original_list = list(original_str.split())
num_words = len(original_list)
num_words_list = []
for i in original_list:
    num_words_list.append((len(i)))

print(num_words_list)

9.# Create an empty string and assign it to the variable lett.
# Then using range, write code such that when your code is run, lett has 7 b’s ("bbbbbbb").

lett = ""

for i in range(7):
    
    lett = lett + "b"

10.# Write a program that uses the turtle module and a for loop to draw something.
# It doesn’t have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. 
# (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over.
# Try setting .speed(10) for the turtle to draw fast, or .speed(0) for it to draw super fast with no animation.)

import turtle

star = turtle.Turtle() 
  
for i in range(50): 
    star.forward(50) 
    star.right(144) 
      
turtle.done()
